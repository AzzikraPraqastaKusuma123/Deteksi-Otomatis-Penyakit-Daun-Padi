- This is a full-stack rice leaf disease detection system called PadiGuard. It includes: 1) Frontend: React application with user authentication, image detection, camera capture, and disease analysis features, 2) Backend: Node.js/Express API with JWT authentication, MySQL database, and ONNX model integration, 3) ML Model: ResNet50V2 model trained on rice leaf diseases, converted to ONNX format for inference, 4) Database: MySQL with tables for users, diseases, and detection results, 5) Features: Image upload/detection, camera capture, detailed disease analysis with Google Gemini API integration.
- The backend server.js file imports express, cors, dotenv, and various route controllers. It loads the ONNX model at startup, sets up middleware for JSON parsing and CORS, serves static files from uploads and public directories, and defines API routes for authentication, users, detections, and diseases.
- The detection service in the backend uses onnxruntime-node for model inference. It loads a ResNet50V2 model in ONNX format, processes images using sharp library (resize to 224x224, normalize to [-1,1]), runs inference, applies softmax to get probabilities, and returns the predicted disease with confidence score. It also integrates with Google Gemini API to get detailed information about the detected disease.
- The frontend has a comprehensive React application with routing for user authentication, detection, disease management, and user profiles. The main detection page allows users to upload images or use camera for real-time detection, with front/back camera switching capability. Results include disease prediction, confidence score, description, prevention tips, and detailed AI-generated analysis.
- The ML model (CNN_Resnet50v2.ipynb) was trained on 8 classes of rice leaf diseases: Bacterial Leaf Blight, Brown Spot, Healthy Rice Leaf, Leaf Blast, Leaf Scald, Narrow Brown Leaf Spot, Rice Hispa, and Sheath Blight. The model achieved 94.25% accuracy on test set and was converted to ONNX format for deployment. The model was trained using TensorFlow with ResNet50V2 as base architecture.
- The database schema includes three main tables: users (with authentication fields), diseases (with disease details like scientific name, description, symptoms, treatment), and detections (storing user detection history with image paths, results, and timestamps). Foreign key relationships connect detections to users.
